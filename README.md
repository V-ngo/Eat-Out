### Eat Out! App

   The idea is for indecisive people who are unsure about what to eat. For example, if they do not know what to eat, they will use the app and it will show them nearby restaurants based on their location.


### App Features

   1) Application will have a welcome screen.
   2) A pop-up notification that asks for the user's location.
   3) A map which shows the current location of the user.
   4) A result screen which displays all restaurants near the user's location.

### Main Features

   1) A preference screen where the user can select to get restaurants based on his/her preferences.
   2) A preference screen has a reset button where users can change preference after reset.
   3) A save button that adds a restaurant to the userâ€™s favorite list.
   4) A list of saved restaurant screen that contains favorite restaurants.
